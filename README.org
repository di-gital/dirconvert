* Dirconvert
Dirconvert is a shell script to convert all of the files in one
directory (typically a musical album) into a another format in a new
directory. It is just a tool for me to convert my audio library across
different formats.

* Running
#+BEGIN_SRC 
chmod +x dirconvert
./dirconvert.sh
#+END_SRC
